####  School_District_Analysis (UCD Module 4:  Python/Anaconda/Pandas/Jupyter Notebook)



# Deliverable 3 Written Report
### Overview/Purpose of the School District Analysis:
Module 4 is an introduction of Python's Jupyter Notebook, an open source web application that is built into Python. Jupyter Notebook can be launched via the Anaconda Prompt.  Throughout the module, we learned more ways to manupulate data using comparison operators and built-in methods to provide strong visuals (much like Excel and VBA). The module also briefly touches on Object-Oriented Programming.
### Results:
The Module 4 Challenge gives instructions to replace all of the math and reading scores of the 9th graders in one high school (Thomas High School) with "NaN," which essentially removes all of those values.
### Summary:
Upon changing the values for Thoms High School 9th Graders' math and reading scores to 'NaN', these are the findings prior to formatting the data. The Average Math Score for Charter schools decreased from 83.47352 to 83.465425 while the Average Math Score for District schools remained at 76.956733. The Average Reading Score for Charter Schools increased from 83.896421 to 83.902315 while the Average Reading Score for District schools remained at 80.9666363. The % Passing Math for Charter schools decreased from 93.620830 to 93.610020 while the % Passing Math for District schools remained at 66.548453. The % Passing Reading for Charter schools decreased from 96.586489 to 96.550223 while the % Passing Reading for District schools remained at 80.799062. The % Overall Passing for Charter schools decreased from 90.432244 to 90.392533 while the % Overall Passing for District schools remained at 53.672208. 
#### After formatting the data, the Average Math Score for Charter Schools remained at 83.5. The Average Reading Score for Charter schools remained at 83.9. The % Passing Math for Charter Schools remained at 94. The % Passing Reading for Charter schools remained at 97. The % Overall Passing for Charter schools remained at 90. All values for District Schools remained the same.
