We don't want the lowest bin to be $578 because there is only one school at or below $578, which is Wilson High School. However, there are four schools that spend less than $585 per student, so $585 will be our lowest bin. Also, because the standard deviation is about 30, we will increase the bins by $30, up to $675. Therefore, the four bins will be: $585, $615, $645, and $675.\n",

In our DataFrame, we make the lower edge equal to 0. If we don't include the 0 for the spending bins, the lowest bin becomes $586–615, which means that the schools that spend less than $586 are not considered. First we'll use the correct spending bins for our ranges, and then we'll leave out the 0 to see how that affects the bins.\n",
